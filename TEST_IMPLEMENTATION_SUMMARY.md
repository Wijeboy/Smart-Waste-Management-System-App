## Test Technologies Used

### Testing Framework
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework with React Native support
- **@testing-library/react-native**: Component testing utilities
- **jest-expo**: Expo-specific Jest preset

### Mocking
- **API Service Mocking**: Mocked `../services/api` for API calls
- **AsyncStorage Mocking**: Mocked for offline storage testing
- **Expo Modules**: Mocked `expo-file-system` and `expo-sharing`

---

## Key Testing Patterns Applied

### 1. **Component Isolation**
Each component tested independently with mocked dependencies:
```javascript
jest.mock('../services/api', () => ({
  startRoute: jest.fn(),
  completeRoute: jest.fn(),
  // ... other mocks
}));
```

### 2. **User Interaction Testing**
Testing real user interactions:
```javascript
fireEvent.press(getByText('Vehicle inspection completed'));
expect(getByText('1 of 5 items checked')).toBeTruthy();
```

### 3. **Edge Case Coverage**
Comprehensive edge case testing:
- Empty data
- Missing fields
- Invalid inputs
- Very large datasets
- Network failures
- Offline scenarios

### 4. **Async Operation Testing**
Proper handling of async operations:
```javascript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(apiService.startRoute).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### 5. **Mock Verification**
Verifying mocks called with correct arguments:
```javascript
expect(apiService.collectBin).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  'route123',
  'bin1',
  { actualWeight: 52 }
);
```

## Test Quality Metrics

### Assertions per Test
- **Average:** 2-3 assertions per test
- **Maximum:** 5 assertions (complex validation tests)
- **Minimum:** 1 assertion (simple rendering tests)

### Test Independence
- ✅ Each test is fully independent
- ✅ No shared state between tests
- ✅ Mock cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks

### Test Readability
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Clear arrange-act-assert structure
- ✅ Well-organized test suites
- ✅ Comprehensive comments

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Confidence in Code Changes**
Tests ensure features work as expected and catch regressions early.

### 2. **Documentation**
Tests serve as living documentation showing how components should be used.

### 3. **Refactoring Safety**
Can refactor with confidence knowing tests will catch breaking changes.

### 4. **Edge Case Coverage**
Comprehensive testing of edge cases and error scenarios.

### 5. **Integration Verification**
Full workflow testing ensures all pieces work together correctly.
