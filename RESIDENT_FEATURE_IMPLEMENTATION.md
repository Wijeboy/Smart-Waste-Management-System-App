# Resident Registration & Bin Management Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the resident user role and bin management features for the Smart Waste Management System.

**Implementation Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **User Role-Based Registration**
- Added "Resident" as a new user role alongside "Collector" and "Admin"
- Implemented role selection dropdown in registration form
- Users can choose between "Waste Collector" and "Resident" during signup

### 2. **Resident Dashboard**
- Created dedicated dashboard for residents with:
  - Welcome header with user name
  - Bin statistics overview (Total, Active, Needs Collection, Avg Fill Level)
  - List of resident-owned bins with real-time status
  - Floating Action Button (FAB) for adding new bins
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - View collection schedules for each bin

### 3. **Bin Ownership & Management**
- Residents can add multiple bins
- Each bin is automatically linked to the resident owner
- Bins are immediately active (no approval needed)
- Residents can view:
  - Bin fill levels
  - Current status
  - Latest collection details (weight, time, collector name)
  - Upcoming collection schedules

### 4. **Admin Integration**
- Admin can see all bins including resident-owned bins
- Resident bins are clearly marked with owner information
- Admin can add resident bins to collection routes
- No differentiation in route management - all bins are treated equally

### 5. **Collection Tracking**
- When collector completes a route and marks a bin as collected:
  - Resident bins automatically store collection details
  - Latest collection includes: weight, collection time, collector name, fill level
  - Residents can view this information in their dashboard

### 6. **Role-Based Navigation**
- Automatic redirection based on user role after login:
  - **Admin** → Admin Dashboard
  - **Collector** → Collector Dashboard
  - **Resident** → Resident Dashboard

- Color-coded fill level indicators
- Tappable for viewing schedules

#### 4. **API Service** (`src/services/api.js`)
**New Methods:**

- `getResidentBinSchedule(binId)`

#### 5. **Navigation** (`src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`)

- Residents automatically redirected to their dashboard

#### 6. **Admin Bin Management** (`src/screens/Admin/BinManagementScreen.js`)

## 📊 Data Flow

### Bin Collection Flow
```
1. Resident creates bin → Stored with owner reference
2. Admin views bins → Sees all bins including resident bins
3. Admin creates route → Adds resident bin to route
4. Collector starts route → Marks bins as collected with weight
5. System updates bin → Populates latestCollection for resident bins
6. Resident views dashboard → Sees collection details
```

### User Journey
```
RESIDENT:
Register (select "Resident") → Login → Resident Dashboard → 
Add Bin → View Bins → Check Fill Levels → View Schedule

ADMIN:
Login → Admin Dashboard → Bin Management → 
See all bins (including resident) → Create Route → 
Add resident bins to routes

COLLECTOR:
Login → Collector Dashboard → View Routes → 
Collect bins → Enter weight → Complete route → 
(Resident bins automatically updated)
```
