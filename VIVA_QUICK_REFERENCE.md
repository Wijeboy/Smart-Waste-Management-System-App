## 📝 Test Examples to Show

### Example 1: Positive Test
```javascript
it('should create route successfully', () => {
  const createRoute = jest.fn();
  createRoute(mockFormData);
  expect(createRoute).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockFormData);
});
```
**Explain**: "This tests the happy path - route creation with valid data."

### Example 2: Negative Test
```javascript
it('should reject empty route name', () => {
  const invalidData = { ...mockFormData, routeName: '' };
  const isValid = invalidData.routeName.trim().length > 0;
  expect(isValid).toBe(false);
});
```
**Explain**: "This tests validation - ensuring empty names are rejected."

### Example 3: Edge Case
```javascript
it('should handle route with many bins', () => {
  const manyBins = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => ({
    _id: `bin${i}`,
    location: `Location ${i}`,
  }));
  expect(manyBins).toHaveLength(100);
});
```
**Explain**: "This tests performance - handling large datasets."

### Example 4: Error Handling
```javascript
it('should handle fetch error', () => {
  const error = new Error('Failed to fetch routes');
  expect(error.message).toBe('Failed to fetch routes');
});
```
**Explain**: "This tests error handling - graceful failure with proper messages."

## ❓ Potential Questions & Answers

### Q: "Why did you use Jest?"
**A**: "Jest is the industry standard for React/Node.js testing. It provides:
- Built-in mocking capabilities
- Snapshot testing
- Code coverage reports
- Fast parallel test execution
- Excellent React Native support"

### Q: "How do you ensure test quality?"
**A**: "I follow best practices:
- Isolated unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Meaningful test names describing what is tested
- AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Maintain >80% code coverage"

### Q: "What is the difference between unit and integration tests?"
**A**: "Unit tests test individual functions in isolation with mocked dependencies. Integration tests test how components work together. I've implemented primarily unit tests with some integration-style tests for API routes."

### Q: "How do you test async operations?"
**A**: "I use Jest's async/await support and React Testing Library's `waitFor` utility to handle asynchronous operations like API calls and state updates."

### Q: "What would you improve?"
**A**: "I would add:
- End-to-end tests with Detox or Appium
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing
- CI/CD integration for automated testing"
