# Bug Fixes - Settings Screen and Bottom Navigation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Profile Modal Not Showing âœ…
**Problem**: Modal was darkening the screen but not displaying the form.

**Root Cause**: The `ResidentEditProfileModal` component requires `user` and `onUpdate` props, but they weren't being passed from `SettingsScreen`.

**Fix**: Updated `SettingsScreen.js` to pass the required props:
```javascript
<ResidentEditProfileModal
  visible={editProfileModalVisible}
  onClose={handleProfileUpdate}
  user={user}              // âœ… Added
  onUpdate={handleProfileUpdate}  // âœ… Added
/>
```

**Result**: Now when residents click "Edit Profile", a proper modal form appears with:
- First Name field
- Last Name field
- Email field
- Phone field
- Form validation
- Save/Cancel buttons

### 2. Change Password Modal Not Showing âœ…
**Status**: Already working correctly - just needed the Edit Profile modal fix for consistency.

**Features**:
- Current Password field (with show/hide toggle)
- New Password field (with show/hide toggle)
- Confirm Password field (with show/hide toggle)
- Comprehensive validation:
  - Required fields
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - Passwords must match
  - New password must differ from current
- Security notice about logout

### 3. Bottom Navigation Styling Enhancement âœ…
**Problem**: Bottom navigation looked too basic and didn't match the app's polished theme.

**Improvements Made**:

#### Visual Enhancements:
1. **Better Border**: Changed from thin gray line to thicker teal-tinted border
   - Before: `borderTopWidth: 1, borderTopColor: progressBarBg`
   - After: `borderTopWidth: 2, borderTopColor: primaryDarkTeal + '20'`

2. **Shadow Effect**: Added subtle shadow for depth
   ```javascript
   shadowColor: '#000',
   shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: -2 },
   shadowOpacity: 0.1,
   shadowRadius: 8,
   elevation: 10,
   ```

3. **Increased Height**: Made tabs more comfortable to tap
   - Before: `height: 60`
   - After: `height: 65`

4. **Better Typography**: Semibold instead of medium weight
   - Before: `fontWeight: FONTS.weight.medium`
   - After: `fontWeight: FONTS.weight.semiBold`

#### Active Tab Styling:
Created custom `TabIcon` component with:
- **Background highlight** when active: Subtle teal background (15% opacity)
- **Larger icon** when active: 28px vs 26px
- **Rounded container**: 12px border radius
- **Better spacing**: Proper padding and margins

#### Code Structure:
```javascript
const TabIcon = ({ focused, icon, focusedIcon }) => (
  <View style={[
    styles.iconContainer,
    focused && styles.iconContainerFocused
  ]}>
    <Text style={[
      styles.icon,
      focused && styles.iconFocused
    ]}>
      {focused ? focusedIcon : icon}
    </Text>
  </View>
);
```

**Before vs After**:

Before:
```
Plain icon, no background
Same size active/inactive
Basic border line
No shadow
```

After:
```
Icon in rounded container
Active has teal background
Larger when active
Thicker teal-tinted border
Professional shadow
Better spacing
```
