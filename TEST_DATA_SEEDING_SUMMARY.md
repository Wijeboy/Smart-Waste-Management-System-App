## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified/Created

### Backend Files:
1. **`backend/models/Route.js`** - Added analytics fields:
   - `binsCollected`
   - `wasteCollected`
   - `recyclableWaste`
   - `efficiency`
   - `satisfaction`
   - `startTime`
   - `endTime`

2. **`backend/controllers/analyticsController.js`** - Updated:
   - Fixed `getWasteDistributionData()` to match Bin model enum values
   - All functions now use real data calculations

3. **`backend/scripts/seedAnalyticsData.js`** - Created:
   - Comprehensive seeding script
   - 15 bins across 4 zones
   - 41 completed routes with historical data
   - 3 active/scheduled routes

---

## üöÄ How to Re-seed Data

If you want to reset and re-populate the data:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/seedAnalyticsData.js
```

This will:
1. Clear all existing bins and routes
2. Create 15 new bins
3. Create 41 completed routes (4 weeks of data)
4. Create 3 active/scheduled routes

---

## üìù Test Data Characteristics

### Realistic Patterns:
- ‚úÖ Variable bin collection numbers (5-10 per route)
- ‚úÖ Variable waste amounts (55-120kg per route)
- ‚úÖ Realistic recycling rates (30-35%)
- ‚úÖ High efficiency scores (78-99%)
- ‚úÖ Good satisfaction ratings (3-5 stars)
- ‚úÖ Increasing trend in week 4 (most recent)
- ‚úÖ Fill levels vary by bin type
- ‚úÖ Multiple zones represented

### Data Distribution:
- General Waste: Highest at 42% (most common)
- Recyclable: 29% (second highest)
- Organic: 26% (third)
- Hazardous: 3% (lowest, as expected)
