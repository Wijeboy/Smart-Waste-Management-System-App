- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Input validation on all API calls
- ✅ Error handling prevents point loss on failures

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Track number of users checking credit points
- Monitor redemption rate
- Measure user retention with rewards program

### Environmental Impact
- Increased recycling (15 pts/kg incentive)
- Higher collection participation
- Better waste segregation

### Business Value
- User satisfaction scores
- Reduced customer service inquiries
- Increased app usage

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting
