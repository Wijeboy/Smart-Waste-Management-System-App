# Real Impact Metrics Implementation

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Replaced mock data with **real-time calculations** based on actual completed bin collections.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### **Before (Mock Data):**
```javascript
// Static mock data - never changed
impactMetrics: {
  recycled: { value: "234", unit: "kg" },
  co2Saved: { value: "45", unit: "kg" },
  treesSaved: { value: "12", unit: "trees" }
}

collectionsByType: [
  { type: "General Waste", count: 15, weight: "120kg", icon: "🗑️" },
  { type: "Recyclable", count: 8, weight: "65kg", icon: "♻️" },
  ...
]
```

### **After (Real Data):**
```javascript
// Calculated dynamically from completed bins
impactMetrics: {
  recycled: { 
    value: totalWeightCollected.toString(), 
    unit: "kg" 
  },
  co2Saved: { 
    value: (totalWeight * 0.5).toString(), 
    unit: "kg" 
  },
  treesSaved: { 
    value: (co2Saved / 0.06).toString(), 
    unit: "trees" 
  }
}

collectionsByType: [
  // Real counts and weights from completed bins by type
]
```

## 📊 How It Works

### **1. Today's Impact Section**

**Data Source:** All bins with `status: 'active'` AND `fillLevel < 50%` (recently collected)

**Calculations:**

| Metric | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Waste Collected** | Sum of all completed bin capacities | 3 bins × 100kg = **300kg** |
| **CO2 Saved** | Waste × 0.5 (1kg waste saves 0.5kg CO2) | 300kg × 0.5 = **150kg** |
| **Trees Saved** | CO2 / 0.06 (1 tree saves 0.06kg CO2/day) | 150 / 0.06 = **2,500 trees** |

**Logic:**
```javascript
const completedBins = bins.filter(
  (bin) => bin.status === 'active' && bin.fillLevel < 50
);

const wasteCollected = completedBins.reduce(
  (total, bin) => total + (bin.capacity || 0), 
  0
);

const co2Saved = Math.round(wasteCollected * 0.5);
const treesSaved = Math.round(co2Saved / 0.06);
```

---

### **2. Today's Collections by Type**

**Data Source:** Same completed bins, grouped by `binType`

**Calculations:**

For each bin type (General Waste, Recyclable, Organic, Hazardous):
- **Count:** Number of completed bins of that type
- **Weight:** Sum of capacities of completed bins of that type

**Example Output:**
```javascript
[
  { 
    type: "General Waste", 
    count: 2,           // 2 bins collected
    weight: "200kg",    // Total capacity collected
    icon: "🗑️" 
  },
  { 
    type: "Recyclable", 
    count: 1,           // 1 bin collected
    weight: "100kg",    // Total capacity collected
    icon: "♻️" 
  },
  { 
    type: "Organic", 
    count: 0,           // No bins collected yet
    weight: "0kg", 
    icon: "🌱" 
  },
  { 
    type: "Hazardous", 
    count: 0,           // No bins collected yet
    weight: "0kg", 
    icon: "☢️" 
  }
]
```

**Logic:**
```javascript
const typeCounts = { 'General Waste': 0, 'Recyclable': 0, ... };
const typeWeights = { 'General Waste': 0, 'Recyclable': 0, ... };

completedBins.forEach((bin) => {
  const type = bin.binType || 'General Waste';
  typeCounts[type]++;
  typeWeights[type] += (bin.capacity || 0);
});
```

**Impact metrics and collections update automatically when:**

### ✅ Bin Marked as Completed
```
User marks BIN001 as Completed

fillLevel: 0%, status: 'active'
  ↓
Home Screen Impact Updates:
  - Waste Collected: +100kg
  - CO2 Saved: +50kg
  - Trees Saved: +833
  ↓
Collections by Type Updates:
  - General Waste count: +1
  - General Waste weight: +100kg
```

### ✅ Bin Changed from Completed to Pending
```
User changes BIN001 from Completed to Pending
  ↓
fillLevel: 85%, status: 'full'
  ↓
Home Screen Impact Updates:
  - Waste Collected: -100kg (decreases)
  - CO2 Saved: -50kg (decreases)
  - Trees Saved: -833 (decreases)
  ↓
Collections by Type Updates:
  - General Waste count: -1
  - General Waste weight: -100kg
```

### ✅ Reset All Bins
```
User clicks "Reset All"
  ↓
All bins: fillLevel: 85%, status: 'full'
  ↓
Home Screen Impact Updates:
  - Waste Collected: 0kg (reset)
  - CO2 Saved: 0kg (reset)
  - Trees Saved: 0 (reset)
  ↓
Collections by Type Updates:
  - All counts: 0
  - All weights: 0kg
```

### ✅ Auto-Reset at Day End
```
Midnight passes (new day)
  ↓
System auto-resets all bins
  ↓
Impact metrics reset to 0
  ↓
Fresh start for new day's collections
```

## 🔍 Calculation Details

### **Environmental Impact Formulas:**

**1. Waste Collected:**
```
Total = Sum of all completed bin capacities
```

**2. CO2 Saved:**
```
Formula: 1kg waste properly disposed saves 0.5kg CO2
CO2 Saved = Waste Collected × 0.5
```

**3. Trees Saved:**
```
Formula: 1 tree absorbs ~22kg CO2 per year
Per day: 22kg / 365 days = 0.06kg CO2/day
Trees Saved = CO2 Saved / 0.06
```

**Example:**
- Collected 300kg waste
- CO2 Saved: 300 × 0.5 = **150kg**
- Trees Saved: 150 / 0.06 = **2,500 trees**
