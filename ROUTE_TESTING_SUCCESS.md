## Features Tested

### Pre-Route Checklist Validation
- ✅ Checklist presence validation
- ✅ Checklist items array validation
- ✅ All items checked validation
- ✅ Checklist data storage in database
- ✅ Route status transition (scheduled → in-progress)
- ✅ Start time recording
- ✅ Authorization checks (collector-only access)
- ✅ Route assignment verification

### Post-Route Summary Calculations
- ✅ Bins collected count
- ✅ Waste collected calculation (actual weight priority)
- ✅ Recyclable waste calculation (by bin type)
- ✅ Route efficiency calculation (collected/total × 100)
- ✅ Route duration calculation (in minutes)
- ✅ All bins processed validation
- ✅ Status transition (in-progress → completed)
- ✅ Completion timestamp recording
- ✅ Analytics data generation

### Weight Calculation Logic
- ✅ **Actual Weight Priority**: Uses `actualWeight` entered by collector
- ✅ **Estimated Weight Fallback**: Uses `fillLevel × capacity` if no actual weight
- ✅ **Zero Weight Handling**: Properly handles 0kg (empty bins)
- ✅ **Logging**: Console logs show which method is used

### Security & Authorization
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Collector role enforcement
- ✅ Route assignment verification
- ✅ Status validation before actions
- ✅ Unauthorized access prevention

---

## Test Data Setup

Each test uses fresh data created in `beforeEach`:

```javascript
// Test Users
Collector: col[timestamp] (role: 'collector')
Admin: adm[timestamp] (role: 'admin')

// Test Bins
Bin 1: General Waste, 100kg capacity, 80% fill
Bin 2: Recyclable, 50kg capacity, 60% fill
Bin 3: Organic, 75kg capacity, 90% fill

// Test Route
Status: 'scheduled'
Assigned to: Collector
Contains: 3 bins in order
```

---

## Pre-Route Checklist Implementation

### Required Checklist Items
1. ✅ Vehicle inspection completed
2. ✅ Safety equipment available
3. ✅ Collection containers ready
4. ✅ Route map reviewed
5. ✅ Communication device functional

### Validation Rules
- All 5 items must be checked
- Checklist must be provided as JSON object
- Items must be an array
- Cannot start route without completed checklist
- Checklist data is stored in database

### API Endpoint
```
PUT /api/routes/:id/start
Authorization: Bearer <collector_token>
Body: {
  preRouteChecklist: {
    completedAt: Date,
    items: [
      { id: '1', label: '...', checked: true },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Post-Route Summary Implementation

### Analytics Data Calculated
- **Bins Collected**: Count of bins with status 'collected'
- **Waste Collected**: Total kg from all collected bins
- **Recyclable Waste**: Total kg from 'Recyclable' type bins
- **Efficiency**: (collected bins / total bins) × 100
- **Route Duration**: Minutes from start to completion
- **Completion Time**: Timestamp when route completed

### Weight Calculation Priority
1. **Actual Weight** (if provided by collector)
2. **Estimated Weight** (fillLevel × capacity)

### API Endpoint
```
PUT /api/routes/:id/complete
Authorization: Bearer <collector_token>
```

### Response Data
```json

  "success": true,
  "message": "Route completed successfully",

## Sample Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Route Completion
```
1. Start route with completed checklist ✅
2. Collect all 3 bins with actual weights ✅
3. Complete route ✅
Result: 
- Bins Collected: 3
- Waste: 178kg (80 + 30 + 67.5)
- Recyclable: 30kg (only bin 2)
- Efficiency: 100%
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Collection with Skipped Bins
```
1. Start route with completed checklist ✅
2. Collect 2 bins, skip 1 bin ✅
3. Complete route ✅
Result:
- Bins Collected: 2
- Waste: 110kg (80 + 30)
- Efficiency: 67% (2/3 × 100)
```

### Scenario 3: Zero Weight Collection
```
1. Start route ✅
2. Collect bins with 0kg actual weight ✅
3. Complete route ✅
Result:
- Waste: 0kg (valid for empty bins)
```

### Scenario 4: Estimated Weight Fallback
```
1. Start route ✅
2. Collect bins WITHOUT entering actual weight ✅
3. Complete route ✅
Result:
- System calculates: fillLevel × capacity
- Bin 1: 80% × 100kg = 80kg
- Bin 2: 60% × 50kg = 30kg
- Bin 3: 90% × 75kg = 67.5kg
- Total: 178kg
```

## Model Updates

### Route Schema Additions
```javascript
// Pre-route checklist
preRouteChecklist: {
  completed: Boolean,
  completedAt: Date,
  items: [{
    id: String,
    label: String,
    checked: Boolean
  }]
}

// Analytics fields
binsCollected: Number,
wasteCollected: Number,
recyclableWaste: Number,
efficiency: Number,
routeDuration: Number (minutes),
satisfaction: Number,
startTime: Date,
endTime: Date
```

---

## Console Logging

Tests show clear logging of weight calculations:

```
✅ Using ACTUAL weight for bin BIN-XXX: 80kg
✅ Using ACTUAL weight for bin BIN-YYY: 30kg
⚠️ Using ESTIMATED weight for bin BIN-ZZZ: 80% × 100kg = 80kg
```

This helps verify the system is prioritizing actual weights correctly!

7. View post-route summary
8. Download report

### 2. Additional Test Scenarios
Consider testing:
- Network failure during checklist submission
- App crash during collection
- Multiple routes in progress
- Route reassignment
- Checklist modification
- Report generation edge cases

### 3. Production Readiness
Before going live:
- [ ] Review all checklist items with stakeholders
- [ ] Verify weight calculation accuracy
- [ ] Test report generation with real data
- [ ] Validate analytics calculations
- [ ] Test offline mode behavior
- [ ] Review security measures
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple routes
