# Modal Display Fix - Edit Profile & Change Password

## Issue Description
When clicking "Edit Profile" or "Change Password" buttons in Settings, the screen darkens (overlay appears) but the modal form doesn't display.

## Root Cause
The modal styling had conflicting layout properties:
1. **ScrollView with `flex: 1`** was causing the modal container to collapse
2. **Width set to `90%`** without proper container padding could cause overflow issues
3. **Missing `statusBarTranslucent`** prop might cause display issues on some devices

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ResidentEditProfileModal.js

#### Added Modal Props:
```javascript
<Modal
  visible={visible}
  animationType="slide"
  transparent={true}
  onRequestClose={handleCancel}
  statusBarTranslucent={true}  // ‚úÖ NEW - Better cross-platform support
>
```

#### Fixed Overlay Styles:
```javascript
overlay: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  padding: 20,  // ‚úÖ NEW - Prevents edge overflow
},
```

#### Fixed Modal Container Styles:
**Before:**
```javascript
modalContainer: {
  width: '90%',
  maxWidth: 500,
  maxHeight: '80%',
  backgroundColor: COLORS.lightCard,
  // ... other styles
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
modalContainer: {
  width: '100%',        // ‚úÖ Changed - Full width within padded overlay
  maxWidth: 500,
  backgroundColor: COLORS.lightCard,
  maxHeight: '90%',     // ‚úÖ Changed - More visible height
  // ... other styles
}
```

#### Fixed ScrollView Styles:
**Before:**
```javascript
scrollView: {
  flex: 1,  // ‚ùå This was causing collapse
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
scrollView: {
  maxHeight: '100%',  // ‚úÖ Proper height constraint
}
```

### 2. ChangePasswordModal.js
Applied identical fixes as above:
- Added `statusBarTranslucent={true}`
- Added `padding: 20` to overlay
- Changed container width from `90%` to `100%`
- Increased maxHeight from `80%` to `90%`
- Changed scrollView from `flex: 1` to `maxHeight: '100%'`

## Why This Works

### The Problem:
```
Overlay (flex: 1)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Modal Container (90% width, 80% maxHeight)
      ‚îî‚îÄ ScrollView (flex: 1) ‚Üê THIS WAS COLLAPSING!
          ‚îî‚îÄ Content (padding: 24)
```

The `flex: 1` on ScrollView was trying to take all available space, but combined with percentage-based maxHeight on the parent, it was causing a layout conflict where the modal would render with 0 height.

### The Solution:
```
Overlay (flex: 1, padding: 20)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Modal Container (100% width, 90% maxHeight)
      ‚îî‚îÄ ScrollView (maxHeight: 100%) ‚Üê NOW VISIBLE!
          ‚îî‚îÄ Content (padding: 24)
```

Now the ScrollView has a definite height constraint relative to its parent, allowing it to render properly.
