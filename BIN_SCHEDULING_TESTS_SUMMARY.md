## Key Implementation Details

### Backend Tests
- **Database:** MongoDB Memory Server (in-memory testing)
- **Models Used:** User, Bin, Route
- **Required Fields:**
  - User: nic, dateOfBirth (learned from Bin Collection tests)
  - Route: routeName, scheduledDate, scheduledTime, bins array
  - Bin: binId, location, zone, binType, capacity, fillLevel, status
- **Valid Enum Values:**
  - Route status: ['scheduled', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'cancelled']
  - Bin zone: ['Zone A', 'Zone B', 'Zone C', 'Zone D']
  - Bin binType: ['General Waste', 'Recyclable', 'Organic', 'Hazardous']

### Frontend Tests
- **Testing Library:** @testing-library/react-native
- **Mocked Dependencies:**
  - colors and dimensions from constants
  - RouteContext (useRoute, useAuth)
  - UserContext (useUser)
  - React Navigation (navigation prop with goBack)
- **Component Props:** navigation object with goBack function
- **Text Content Tested:**
  - "Collection Scheduling Module"
  - "Scheduling" (header title)
  - "Features will include:"
  - "• Pickup scheduling for residents"
  - "• Different bin types support"
  - "• Service feedback collection"
  - "← Back" (back button with arrow)

## Test Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Import Path
- **Problem:** SchedulingScreen.js is in `src/screens/` not `src/screens/Scheduling/`
- **Fix:** Changed import from `'../SchedulingScreen'` to `'../../SchedulingScreen'`

### Issue 2: Missing Mocks
- **Problem:** colors and dimensions from constants caused undefined errors
- **Fix:** Added mock for `../../../constants/colors` with all required values

### Issue 3: Multiple Elements Found
- **Problem:** "Scheduling" and "Back" text appear multiple times (header + content)
- **Fix:** Used `getAllByText()` instead of `getByText()` and selected first element [0]

### Issue 4: Navigation Prop
- **Problem:** navigation.goBack() was undefined
- **Fix:** Created mockNavigation object and passed as prop to component

## Comparison with Bin Collection Tests

### Similarities
- Both use same testing frameworks (Jest + MongoDB Memory Server)
- Both require User model with nic and dateOfBirth
- Both use valid enum values for Bin zones and binTypes
- Both mock contexts and navigation
- Both test positive and negative scenarios

### Differences
- **Bin Collection:** Tests collectBin and skipBin endpoints (9 tests)
- **Bin Scheduling:** Tests createRoute, getAllRoutes, updateRoute (11 tests)
- **Bin Collection:** 5 frontend screens tested (113+ tests)
- **Bin Scheduling:** 1 frontend screen tested (47 tests - placeholder screen)
- **Bin Collection:** More complex frontend with multiple screens
- **Bin Scheduling:** Simpler frontend with "Coming Soon" placeholder

---

## Notes

1. **SchedulingScreen is a placeholder** - Current implementation shows "Coming Soon" message with planned features. Tests validate this placeholder state.

2. **Tests match actual implementation** - All tests were written to match the existing code without modifying it (per user requirements).

3. **No modifications to existing code** - Only test files were created; no changes to source code.

4. **Future-proof tests** - When SchedulingScreen is fully implemented, tests provide good coverage of basic rendering and navigation.
