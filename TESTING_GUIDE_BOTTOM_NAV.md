## Known Issues to Check

### Potential Issues to Watch For:
1. **ResidentTabNavigator Not Found Error**
   - If app crashes on resident login, check import path in AppNavigator

2. **ChangePasswordModal API Call**
   - Verify backend has `/auth/change-password` endpoint
   - Check if it expects `oldPassword` or `currentPassword`

3. **Collection History Empty**
   - New users won't have history until bins are collected
   - This is expected behavior

4. **Fill Level Display**
   - Should show calculated percentage after collection
   - Should show 0% only when scheduled for collection
   - Verify logic works correctly

---

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing, please note:
1. **What were you doing?** (Step-by-step)
2. **What did you expect to happen?**
3. **What actually happened?**
4. **Any error messages?** (Screenshot if possible)
5. **Which tab/screen?**

## Quick Test Summary

For a quick smoke test, perform these essential tests:
1. ‚úÖ Login as resident
2. ‚úÖ Verify all 4 tabs appear
3. ‚úÖ Switch between all tabs

1. Create pull request for feature branch
