### 2. Stripe Config (after login)
```
http://localhost:3001/api/payments/config
```
Requires authentication token.

## 🐛 If Something's Not Working

cd backend
node server.js
```
Should see: "Server running in development mode on port 3001"

cd waste-management-app
npm install
npm start
```

### Can't Connect?
